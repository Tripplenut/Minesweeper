# Minesweeper Flutter

This is where the Flutter portion of this project is stored. This is the playable version of the game. Instructions on how to play are in the root README.md. The documentation is atrocious, and I was too scared to make multiple files, so the code is painful to go through. But the game looks good and works, so it's a success.
