## Back Story

For my AP Computer Science A class we had an end-of-the-year final project. The project gave us free rein on what we wanted to create. The only requirement was to use Java and at least three things we learned from the class. My classmates and I were able to ease these requirements and allow the project to be created in any language of our choice. Some chose to stick with Java, and others decided to use their favorite languages like JavaScript and Python. I was left at a crossroads. Do I stick to Java and make something cool but not learn much, or should I pick up a whole new programming language in the month deadline we had? As any logical person would, I did both! So then I wondered what I could make in 2 languages that are functional in both. I started to look at my classmate's rough ideas for board games and solitaire. I noticed that since these were done in Java, there would be no visuals, and that's when the idea came to me. I can code something complex in Java but then learn a language and framework to make visuals. I decided to make minesweeper since my final school semester was spent grinding the game.

## Description

Microsoft Minesweeper or whoever first created the game. It is programmed in both Java and Flutter/Dart. Java is what I used to figure out the mechanics of the game, and Flutter/Dart is for the visuals and the playable version of the game. If you would like to play the game on mobile, it can be found on the google play store (I hope). If you want to play it on a Windows computer, the file for download can be found here.

## Things I learned

Brief: I was able to learn the basics of the Flutter framework and a little bit about how to code in dart, but it was similar enough to Java that it wasn't difficult. I also learned all about Minesweeper inside out to the point where I can't play the game for more than 5 minutes without wanting to gouge my eyes out. That's a little excessive, but it sapped the fun out of accidentally clicking on bombs.

Lengthy: If you want to get my day-to-day feelings, struggles, and success, you can check the [StepByStep.md](/StepByStep.md). It is where I explain the entire development processâ€”the concepts of minesweeper, java, flutter, and dart I had to learn.
